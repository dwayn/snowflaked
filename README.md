# Introduction
This is a C implementation of Twitter's snowflake algorithm as a standalone daemon and client

Snowflake is an uncoordinated, distributed unique id generator that generates roughly ordered 64bit integer IDs. 

The algorithm generates a time based ID that gains its entropy from the region id, worker id, and sequence bits. 
Region id and worker id must be a unique combination for each snowflaked process that is generating IDs for a single 
ID space. The sequence number is reset to 0 at the beginning of each millisecond and the first ID generated by a 
snowflaked daemon will use 0 as its sequence and then increment the sequence number for the next request within that 
millisecond. If clocks on all servers running snowflaked process are in sync, the IDs are ordered down to the millisecond, 
but IDs generated within a single millisecond are not ordered. In practice, due to clock skew, the IDs generated could be 
unordered at a higher granularity. NTP clock adjustments are handled by the daemon to ensure that IDs are not regenerated 
when NTP adjusts the system clock backwards. ___Note: NTP should be configured and running on all hosts running snowflaked.___


Parts of a snowflake ID:

* sign bit: will always be 0
* next 41 bits: milliseconds since custom epoch
* next 4 bits: region id
* next 10 bits: worker id
* lowest 8 bits: sequence number

         sign           ms since custom epoch            region    worker     sequence  
        | 0 |                               16917051000 |    2 |         26 |       37 |
        | 0 | ----------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | -------- |
        | 0 | 00000001111110000010101011011011001111000 | 0010 | 0000011010 | 00100101 |
        
        ID: 70955254678034981

This has been implemented to always provide positive signed 64bit integers rather than 
using unsigned 64bit integers so that Java (prior to version 8) can use these IDs without 
painful workarounds.

The number of bits assigned to each of the parts as well as the custom epoch start time can be 
adjusted in `src/snowflake.h` by modifying the `SNOWFLAKE_*` constants and the project recompiled. 
Be sure that the sum of the 4 `*_BITS` constants does not exceed 63 bits as that will cause overflow 
on the ID.



Included in this project is the server (snowflaked), command line client (snowflake) and a 
simple C load generation program (sfbench)

        -p PORT, --port PORT
                            Port number for the server to run on. 
                            Default: 8008


#### `snowflake`
Command line client for snowflaked

Optional Arguments

        -h HOST, --host HOST
                            Hostname of the server to query
                            Default: localhost

        -p PORT, --port PORT
                            Port number on the server to query
                            Default: 8008


#### `sfbench`
Command line client for generating load on snowflaked daemon

        -h HOST, --host HOST
                            Hostname of the server to query
                            Default: localhost

        -p PORT, --port PORT
                            Port number on the server to query
                            Default: 8008

        -n ITERATIONS, --iterations ITERATIONS
                            Number of ID GET calls to make to the server
                            Default: 1000

        -m MODVALUE         Modulus value to set how often to write to stdout
                            Default: 1 (write line to stdout for every GET call)


### Clients
#### PHP
There is an extension for PHP in `clients/php` that can be compiled. See [clients/php/README.md](clients/php/README.md)

#### Python
_Coming soon_

#### Others client libraries
Node.js, Ruby, Java, Scala, etc: I plan to chip away at writing clients for many other languages, but
if anyone would like to help with writing more client libraries, let me know and I would be happy to help out


# Building

## Dependencies
#### Library dependencies:
* libevent 2.x
* check 0.9.8  (need to test if check lib detection is working properly)


#### Build dependencies:
* libtoolize/glibtoolize
* autotools (aclocal, autoheader, autoconf, automake)


#### Debug build dependencies:
* gperftools


### Installing dependencies
### Mac OSX
If you have homebrew installed, you can run the following to install all needed build dependencies:
        
        ./homebrew_install_dependencies.sh

### Debian/Ubuntu

        sudo apt-get install libevent-dev pkg-config check libtool automake autoconf gperftools

_you can leave out gperftools if you are not planning on compiling the debug version_

### RHEL/CentOS

        sudo yum install libevent-devel pkgconfig check libtool automake autoconf gperftools

_you can leave out gperftools if you are not planning on compiling the debug version_

## Compiling/Installing:
* ./bootstrap.sh
* ./configure [--enable-debug]
* make
* sudo make install





# Protocol
The daemon implements a simple text protocol:


#### Get ID request:

        Get\r\n

##### Server ID response: 
64bit integer preceeded by "+"

        +70955254678034981\r\n
        
##### Server error response:
If there is an error, the response will be preceeded by "-"

        -ERROR error message\r\n

#### Get server stats:

        INFO\r\n

##### Server info response

        uptime:16761\r
        version:00.02.00\r
        region:0\r
        worker:39\r
        seq_cap:255\r
        seq_max:84\r
        ids:334241\r
        waits:0\r\n

* uptime - Seconds since server started
* version - Compiled version of the server
* region - Region ID for the server
* worker - Worker ID for the server
* seq_cap - Max sequence ID that can be generated
* seq_max - The highest sequence number that the server has generated since it was started
* ids - The number of IDs that the server has generated since it was started
* waits - The number of times the server has had to enter a wait loop to generate an ID
 * This can be caused by hitting the sequence number cap or by waiting due to an NTP clock adjustment that rolled time backwards on the host






### TODO
* Tests for snowflaked components
